              information about file (see below). Otherwise this line is copied
              without change into the ListDirectory outcome entry for the file.

     Character 1 is 'D' if the file is a directory
     Character 2 is "R" if the file is readable by the Xlogin (effective uid/gid)
     Character 3 is "W" if the file is writable by the Xlogin (effective uid/gid)
     Character 4 is "X" if the file is executable by the Xlogin (effective uid/gid)
     Character 5 is "O" if the file is owned by the Xlogin (effective uid/gid)
     Character 6 is a space.

     Until the next space is a decimal integer which is the size of the file in bytes.

     Until the next space is a decimal integer which is the last modification
     time of the file in seconds since the Unix epoch.

     Extended permissions specification is encoded on the next line as follows:
